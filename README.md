# Double-slit-Calculator

Problem Addressed: Can one teach quantum physics to younger students easily and efficiently using technology (digital programs that assist experiments/calculate values from given variables/demonstrate results using graphs)?

# Description

Scientist Richard Feynman once said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics” . It is therefore evident that quantum physics can be particularly challenging to both teach and learn, when focusing on high school students. 

The double-slit experiment demonstrates the wave nature of light and particles through interference patterns.
This project provides both a theoretical study and a digital analysis model of the experiment.

The work includes:

A theoretical overview of the principles behind the double-slit experiment

An experimental component where measurements are collected

A Python-based computational model to analyze the resulting interference patterns

# Educational Impact 

This project supports UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) by:

Providing a digital tool for learning wave physics

Making experimental data analysis more accessible

Helping students visualize and understand wave interference
